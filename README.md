Milestone 3 TODO:
1. Landscape orientation
2. Back button on toolbar
3. If a user created the item, the "Contact Seller" button should say "Edit Item" instead. 
4. Menu bar with options

Dr. Layman, 

If you read this, I could use some help for the third problem. What is the most efficient way to accomplish this task? Should 
I create 2 different .XML views and then load one based one the user? Or, should I have two buttons and load one based one the 
user? Or, should I have one button and change the properties of the button based on the user? Which would work the best?

Thanks for any help,
Alex Bolsoy
