Milestone 2 Problems:
1. Add a style to the buttons. 
2. When the app is killed and reopened, the user is still logged in. The user should be logged out whenever the app is killed.
3. MainActivity?
4. AccountActivity?

Dr. Layman, 

If you read this, I could use some help for the first 2 problems. Do you have any pointers? Like where I should start or how 
you would approach it? 

Thanks for any help,
Alex Bolsoy
